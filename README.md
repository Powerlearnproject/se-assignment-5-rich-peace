   Customizing Settings:

   Most settings can be modified directly within the Settings editor. Here are some examples:

   Changing Theme:
   Search for "Color Theme" in the Settings editor.
   A dropdown menu will appear with various built-in themes (e.g., Dark+, Light+). Select the desired theme to apply it.
   You can also install additional themes from the VS Code Marketplace ([VS Code Marketplace]).
   Adjusting Font Size:
   Search for "Font Size" in the Settings editor.
   A numerical input field will appear. Enter the desired font size (e.g., 14, 16) and press Enter to apply the change.
   Customizing Keybindings:
   Search for "Keyboard Shortcuts" in the Settings editor.
   You'll see a list of default keybindings for various actions.
   To modify a keybinding, click on the action you want to change (e.g., "Save").
   A text box will appear where you can press the new desired key combination.
   VS Code also allows you to import and export keybinding configurations (useful for sharing preferences with your team).
   Settings File (Optional):

   For advanced users, VS Code settings can also be edited directly in a JSON file. Navigate to the File menu and select Preferences > Settings (or Code > Preferences > Settings on macOS). Then, click the button in the top right corner labeled "Open Settings (JSON)". This opens the "settings.json" file where you can manually edit settings in JSON format.

    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

   1. Initializing a Git Repository:

   Open the folder containing your project files in VS Code.
   Go to the Source Control view in the Activity Bar (or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+G).
   Click on the "+" icon in the Source Control view and select Initialize Repository. This creates a new Git repository within your project folder.
   2. Making Commits:

   Once you've made changes to your code, stage those changes for inclusion in the next commit. Stage specific files by right-clicking on them in the Explorer view and selecting "Stage Changes," or stage all changes using the Source Control view buttons.
   Click on the Source Control view and locate the "Changes" section. This shows all staged and unstaged changes.
   In the message box below the "Changes" section, write a clear and concise commit message describing the changes you made.
   Click on the blue button labeled "Commit" (or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Enter). This creates a snapshot of your code with the provided commit message.
   3. Pushing Changes to GitHub:

   Assuming you have a remote repository set up on GitHub for your project, you'll need to connect your local repository to it.
   In the terminal within VS Code (open it using Ctrl+ or navigate to the Terminal tab in the Activity Bar), run the command git remote add origin <remote_repository_URL>. Replace <remote_repository_URL> with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.
   Now you can push your local commits to the remote repository using the command git push origin <branch_name>. Replace <branch_name> with the name of the branch you want to push changes to (usually "main").
   VS Code Integration Benefits:

   Visual Representation: The Source Control view provides a clear overview of staged and unstaged changes, making it easy to manage your commits.
   Inline Diff Viewer: View code changes directly within the editor with a side-by-side comparison of the previous and current versions.
